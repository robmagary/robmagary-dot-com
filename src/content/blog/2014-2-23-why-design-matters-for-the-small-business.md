# Why Design Matters for the Small Business

As a designer, my opinion about all things design is biased. You could even say prejudice when it comes to design and businesses. When I encounter a small or local business with an outdated website or a poorly conceived logo, I can't help but make a negative judgment about that organization. But what about the non-designer? Does the average customer of these small or local businesses notice or make judgments? Does design matter to them? My contention is yes, and in more ways than most may think.

Many small and local businesses want to be judged by their work or product, not their graphic design. They may figure that what they have isn't great, but it's good enough, and they would instead focus on the product or service. In their minds, this should also be what the potential customer focuses on. The problem is that many people need to gain the experience, knowledge, or resources to judge a business based on their product or services. Take lawn care as an example. How would a potential customer compare "lawn company A" to "lawn company B?" Getting a list of all their clients and driving around and surveying their work and service is not practical. So instead, potential customers make snap judgments based on the information they do have, like the websites and logos. Many times, it's not even what those things say directly on the "about us" page because that can't always be trusted. But what they say indirectly speaks directly to the subconscious. For instance, if "lawn company A" has a professional website, it says, "I value your opinion of my business" and "I have a clear message I am sending."

So, how do potential customers make these decisions? Usually, they are quick and based on things they may not be fully aware of. So yes, design should matter as much to small or local businesses as it does to any.
