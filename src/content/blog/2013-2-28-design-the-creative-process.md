# Design: The Creative Process

Where do good design ideas come from? If I knew, I would always return to that well and produce another good idea. Good ideas are challenging to manufacture in any reliable fashion, which has played out repeatedly in my creative life.

My latest project includes creating an identity and UI graphics for the app "Art in the Moment." The app is based on a sort of therapy where people living with dementia are taken to a museum to view art and then engage in a discussion about the artwork afterward. This creative process went smoothly, and I am pleased with the results. I was happy with the initial results, and the client was also. The process was simple. First, I did some sketches and wrote out some keywords, then started working in Photoshop. Oh, if it were always that easy.
