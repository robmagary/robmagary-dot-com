# Comprehensive Pain and Spine Website is Updated

After designing and coding their original website in the fall of 2011, it was time for an update. Because I had all of the content already, the update went quickly. I chose a combination of Twitter Bootstrap and HTML5 Boilerplate for the template. [Initializr.com](http://www.initializr.com/) is a site that will build a customized combination of Bootstrap and HTML5 Boilerplate.
The original site design from 2011 had several pages, but each page had very little information. In the redesign, I decided there was no need to spread the content across multiple pages (and force multiple HTTP requests), so I combined it into a continuous scroll-style site.
